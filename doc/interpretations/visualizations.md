# Visualization Interpretation Guide

This document explains how to interpret the various plots and graphs generated by the `ForensicVisualizer` module. These visuals are saved in the `results/run_[timestamp]/visualizations/` directory.

## Interactive HTML Visualizations

These files are interactive plots that you can open in a web browser.

### `attribution_network.html`
-   **Type**: Interactive Network Graph
-   **Purpose**: To show addresses that are likely controlled by the same entity due to **behavioral similarity**, not direct transactions.
-   **Interpretation**: An edge between two nodes (addresses) means they have a very similar "fingerprint" (e.g., same transaction timing, gas price strategy). This is a powerful tool for expanding an investigation, as it can link wallets that have no on-chain connection.

### `behavioral_pattern_dashboard.html`
-   **Type**: Interactive Dashboard
-   **Purpose**: To visualize the clusters of mixer usage patterns found by the `DepositWithdrawalPatternAnalyzer`.
-   **Interpretation**:
    -   **Cluster Sizes (Bar Chart)**: Shows how many addresses fall into each behavioral archetype (e.g., "active_mixer", "systematic_user").
    -   **Risk vs. Interleaving (Scatter Plot)**: This is key for finding sophisticated actors. Addresses with a high "Interleaving Score" (they frequently mix deposits and withdrawals) and a high "Risk Score" are likely using mixers strategically for illicit purposes.

### `frequent_behavioral_patterns.html`
-   **Type**: Interactive Bar Chart
-   **Purpose**: To display the most common "Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures" (TTPs) found by analyzing sequences of actions.
-   **Interpretation**: This gives a macro view of adversary strategy. If the top pattern is `('small', 'small', 'large')`, it tells you that "structuring" (breaking large amounts into smaller ones) is a dominant TTP in your dataset.

### `temporal_anomaly_activity.html`
-   **Type**: Interactive Timeline
-   **Purpose**: Shows the overall transaction volume and count over time, with periods of statistically anomalous activity highlighted in red.
-   **Interpretation**: This chart helps you find coordinated events. A sudden, massive spike in transaction volume highlighted as an anomaly might correspond to the date of a known hack, indicating that the funds from that hack are present in your dataset.

### `multihop_sankey_{path_id}.html`
-   **Type**: Interactive Sankey Diagram
-   **Purpose**: Visualizes a single, specific multi-hop transaction path that was flagged as suspicious.
-   **Interpretation**: This plot allows you to trace the flow of funds from a source to a destination through multiple intermediary addresses. It's a direct visualization of a "layering" or "chaining" money laundering pattern.

## Static Image Visualizations (.png)

These files are static images suitable for direct inclusion in reports.

### `risk_contribution_{address}.png`
-   **Type**: Bar Chart
-   **Purpose**: Provides "explainability" for a high-risk address's score.
-   **Interpretation**: Each bar represents a risk component (e.g., `TORNADO_CASH_INTERACTION`, `multihop_risk`). The length of the bar shows how much that specific finding contributed to the address's final risk score.

### `cluster_network_graph_{cluster_id}.png`
-   **Type**: Network Graph
-   **Purpose**: Shows the internal transaction flows within a single high-risk cluster.
-   **Interpretation**: Look for structural patterns like hubs (central nodes), spokes, and cycles (`A->B->C->A`), which are strong indicators of coordinated fund management and obfuscation.

### `cluster_activity_timeline.png`
-   **Type**: Gantt-style Chart
-   **Purpose**: Displays the active lifespan of the largest or riskiest clusters.
-   **Interpretation**: Look for clusters that were created and became active at the same time. This "synchronized activation" is a strong signal that a single entity created all of them at once for a specific operation.

### `behavioral_pattern_similarity.png`
-   **Type**: Heatmap
-   **Purpose**: Shows the cosine similarity between the centroids of the behavioral clusters.
-   **Interpretation**: Bright squares on the diagonal indicate that clusters are distinct. Bright off-diagonal squares indicate that two different clusters share very similar behavioral characteristics, suggesting a potential meta-pattern.

## `advanced_static_visuals/` Sub-folder

This folder contains PNG versions of key plots, optimized for high-resolution embedding in static reports or academic papers.

-   `inter_cluster_fund_flow.png`: A static Sankey diagram showing how funds move *between* the largest clusters.
-   `temporal_activity_heatmap.png`: A heatmap of transaction volume by day of the week and hour of the day, showing the "heartbeat" of the entire dataset.
-   `risk_score_distribution.png`: A static histogram of the final risk scores.
-   `risk_vs_value_scatter.png`: A static scatter plot showing the relationship between risk and average transaction value, often revealing a "U-shaped" curve where both very low-value (structuring) and very high-value (smash-and-grab) activities are risky.
